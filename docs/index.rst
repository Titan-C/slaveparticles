Welcome to Slave Particles's documentation!
===========================================

Slave Particles are a representation of physical electron operators. The fermion
operator is expressed in terms of constrained(slave) auxiliary fields that
enlarge the Hilbert space but are subject to local restrictions that eliminate
unphysical states.
