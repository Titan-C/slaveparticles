Slave Spins Mean Field Theory
=============================

The previous introduction to the slave spins, slave particle formulation, to
treat the Hubbard Hamiltonian and deal with the quartic term that deals with
the correlations is only valid in the simplified case of degenerate orbitals at
half-filling. When aiming to introduce dopping, a more elaborate formulation is
required. The fact is that the Spin hamiltonian is unable to manage dopping
cases as previously formulated, since it is always populated by 2 spin which
flip by the action of the operator $S^x$ in a balanced maner. This is
equivalent to the real electron hopping from one lattice site to the next.

Thus to include electron or hole dopping, The fermion hamiltonian deals with it
through the chemical potential, which doesn't appear in the Spin hamiltonian.
Then a new generic Spin operator needs to be introduced, to treat this spin
flip unbalance in the Spin system and deal with the dopping cases.
