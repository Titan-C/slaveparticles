Slave Particles
===============

Representation of physical electron operators. The fermion is expressed in
terms of constrained(slave) auxiliary fields that enlarge the Hilbert space
but are subject to local restrictions that eliminate unphysical states.


Slave Spin
----------

Start from the observation of the possible occupancies of a spinless fermion on
a given site, $n_d=0$ and $n_d=1$, they can be represented as two possible
states of a spin-$1/2$ variable, $S^z=-1/2$ and $S^z=+1/2$. To ensure, in this
fermionic context, the anti-commutation properties and auxiliary fermion $f$ is
introduced, with the additional local constrain:

.. math::  f^\dagger f = S^z + \frac{1}{2}
   :label: slavespinrestriction

In this manner vacuum state and occupied states are represented as

.. math::
   \ket{\emptyset} & = \ket{n_f=0,S^z = -1/2} \\
   \ket{1} & \equiv d^\dagger\ket{\emptyset} = \ket{n_f=1,S^z = +1/2}

And the constrain eliminates the unphysical states

.. math::
   \ket{n_f=1,S^z = -1/2} \\
   \ket{n_f=0,S^z = +1/2}

It is important to note that the spin-$1/2$ variable has nothing to do with the
actual spin of the particle. Spins are treated independently and the spin-$1/2$
variable is just to give the presence of the particle. To exemplify this, the
orbital base $\{\ket{\emptyset}, \ket{\uparrow}, \ket{\downarrow}, \ket{\uparrow
\downarrow}\}$ is written in this extended Hilbert space as:

.. math::
   \ket{\emptyset} &= \ket{n_f = 0; S^z_\uparrow = -1/2}\ket{n_f = 0; S^z_\downarrow = -1/2} \\
   \ket{\emptyset} &= \ket{n_f = 1; S^z_\uparrow = 1/2}\ket{n_f = 0; S^z_\downarrow = -1/2} \\
   \ket{\emptyset} &= \ket{n_f = 0; S^z_\uparrow = -1/2}\ket{n_f = 1; S^z_\downarrow = 1/2} \\
   \ket{\emptyset} &= \ket{n_f = 1; S^z_\uparrow = 1/2}\ket{n_f = 1; S^z_\downarrow = 1/2}

The Hamiltonian for the isolated atom, with degenerated $2N$ fermions in spin
and orbital reads:

.. math::
   \mathcal{H} = \frac{U}{2} \left( \sum_{n} d_n^\dagger d_n - N \right)^2
    -\mu \sum_{n} d_n^\dagger d_n

When introducing the new operators in this Hamiltonian the Lagrange multipliers
are also included to account for the restriction :eq:`slavespinrestriction` to
avoid the unphysical states.

.. math::
   \mathcal{H} = \frac{U}{2} \left( \sum_{n} S_n^z \right)^2
     + \lambda \sum_{n} \left( S_n^z +\frac{1}{2} - f_n^\dagger f_n \right)
    -\mu \sum_{n} f_n^\dagger f_n

This separates in 2 Hamiltonians:

.. math::
   \mathcal{H}_f &= -(\lambda + \mu) \sum_{n} f_n^\dagger f_n \\
   \mathcal{H}_s &= \frac{U}{2} \left( \sum_{n} S_n^z \right)^2
                    +\lambda \sum_{n} (S_n^z + \frac{1}{2})

The spin Hamiltonian has a spectrum :math:`E_{Q \leftarrow S+1/2} = U/2(Q-N)^2 +\lambda Q`,
where $Q$ is the present charge. To find the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$ take
$0=\frac{\partial <\mathcal{H}>}{\partial \lambda}$ because restrictions are treated always in average.

.. math::
   0 &=-\sum_{n} < f_n^\dagger f_n>_f + \sum_{n} <S_n^z>_s \\
   2Nn_F(\lambda +\mu) &= 2N<S_n^z + \frac{1}{2}> = <S^z> + N = <Q> \\
   2Nn_F(\lambda +\mu) &=
   \mathcal{Z}^{-1} \sum_{Q=0}^{2N} \binom{2N}{Q} Q e^{\beta(U/2(Q-N)^2 +\lambda Q)}


Where every term is averaged with its corresponding Hamiltonian, $n_F$ is the Fermi
distribution and the Grand Canonical Partittion function is $\mathcal{Z}^{-1} \sum_{Q=0}^{2N} \binom{2N}{Q} Q e^{\beta(U/2(Q-N)^2 +\lambda Q)}$. Then by numerial root finding the
multiplier $\bar{\lambda}(\mu,\beta)$ allows for to describe the mean fermion occupation,
which is $2Nn_F(\mu + \bar{\lambda}(\mu,\beta))$ and can recuperate the complete Coulomb ladder. It
then has to be compared to the exact solution:

.. math::
   2N<d^\dagger d> =  \mathcal{Z}^{-1} \sum_{Q=0}^{2N} \binom{2N}{Q} Q e^{\beta(U/2(Q-N)^2 -\mu Q)}

The Hamiltonian in this case when there is no Hund coupling($J=0$) and in a lattice reads:

.. math::
   \mathcal{H}_0 = -\sum_m t_m \sum_{<i,j>, \sigma} (d^\dagger_{im\sigma}d_{jm\sigma} +h.c.)
    + \sum_{im\sigma}(\epsilon_m - \mu)d^\dagger_{im\sigma}d_{im\sigma}



Then when dealing with a multi orbital system, $2N$  new spin-$1/2$ variables,
$S^z_{m\sigma}$ and $2N$ auxiliary fermions $f_{m\sigma}$ are introduced, where
$m=1, \cdots, N$ is the number of orbitals. And the local constrain is applied
on each lattice site($i$):

.. math::  f_{im\sigma}^\dagger f_{im\sigma} = S_{im\sigma}^z + \frac{1}{2}
   :label: slavespinrestriction_multiorbitalsite
